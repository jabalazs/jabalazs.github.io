I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of prof.
[Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/), currently working on Deep Learning applied
to Natural Language Processing, specially on how exploiting morphological
information can help us obtain better word representations.

Previous research involved predicting textual entailment between pairs of
sentences in the context of the 2017 RepEval Shared Task. You can read our paper
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03103).

My past research included creating an Opinion Mining platform for analyzing
tweets related to a Chilean retail company. You can read my thesis
[here](assets/Thesis-Jorge-Balazs.pdf).
