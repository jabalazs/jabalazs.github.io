I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of prof.
[Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/), currently working on Deep Learning applied
to Natural Language Processing, specially on how exploiting morphological
information can help in obtaining better word representations.

My [latest paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-3016/) studies gating
mechanisms for combining pre-trained and character-derived word representations.

Before that I [worked](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6208/) on Implicit
Emotion Recognition in the context of [WASSA
2018](http://implicitemotions.wassa2018.com/), obtaining second place in the
related shared task, and the Best System Analysis Paper award. [Previous
research](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-5310/) involved developing
architectures for predicting textual entailment between pairs of sentences in
the context of the 2017 [RepEval](https://repeval2017.github.io) Shared Task.
