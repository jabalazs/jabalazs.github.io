My latest research involved predicting textual entailment between pairs of sentences in the context of the 2017 RepEval Shared Task. You can read our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03103">here</a>!

My past research included creating an Opinion Mining platform for analyzing tweets related to a Chilean retail company. You can read my thesis <a href="assets/Thesis-Jorge-Balazs.pdf">here</a>.
