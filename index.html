I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of prof. <a href="http://ymatsuo.com/">Yutaka Matsuo</a>, currently working on Deep Learning applied to Natural Language Processing. Specifically on how exploiting morphological information can help us obtain better word representations.

Previous research involved predicting textual entailment between pairs of sentences in the context of the 2017 RepEval Shared Task. You can read our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03103">here</a>.

My past research included creating an Opinion Mining platform for analyzing tweets related to a Chilean retail company. You can read my thesis <a href="assets/Thesis-Jorge-Balazs.pdf">here</a>.
